<h3>
  WAN
</h3>
<p>
  Here you configure how your {PLATFORM} will handle your Wide Area Network (WAN) port. The default setting is to Obtain an IP address.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Obtain IP-address automatically (DHCP)</strong> - The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) automates the assignment of IP address, Netmask, Default gateway, and other IP parameters.
  Use this option if your internet provider requires you to use DHCP. This is the default and most common option.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Use static IP address settings</strong> - Static IP address, Netmask, Default gateway and Primary DNS are manually assigned to {PLATFORM} by the administrator. Use this option if your internet
  provider requires you to manually enter the values.
</p>
<p>
  Please notice that the WAN settings are not editable in the profile 'Automatic network settings', shown for information only.
