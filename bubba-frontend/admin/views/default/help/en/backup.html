<p>
  This backup service allows you to backup any data on your {PLATFORM} to a USB disk, an eSATA disk or to a remote server supporting FTP or SSH protocols. For instance you can create a backup from one {PLATFORM} to
  another using the SSH protocol, and using the EasyFind name as the “target server”.
</p>
<p>
  The backup service is timelined, hence you can choose to restore your data from any of the backup occasions. For instance if you create a backup job you run hourly, and need to restore a file to
  the state it had four hours earlier, this is possible.
</p>
<p>
  The backup can also be run differentially. This means that it will only send changes that might have taken place in your data. If no changes are made, no data is being sent and no additional
  storage space is used on the target.
</p>
<p>
  You can also choose to encrypt the backup. If you choose this, the backup is encrypted both during transfer to target and on the actual target. This allows you to send backups to untrusted servers
  without worrying that someone might read your backup data.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Note: If you misplace the password you use to create an encrypted backup, you will not be able to restore this backup!</em>
</p>

  Restore a backup not using {PLATFORM}
</h3>
<p>
  If you in the future would like to restore a backup not using {PLATFORM}, this is possible but does require a Linux machine with the Duplicity software installed.
  Just point Duplicity to the backup target and perform the restore. Note that you still ned the password if you chose to encrypt your backup
</p>
<h3>
  How long will my backup take?
</h3>
<p>
  The first time a backup runs it can be very time consuming. For example 500 digital photos of 5 MB each would take approximately five hours to complete the first time,
  over a fast internet connection or to a local device.
  <em>Note: The following backups only sends changes (new photos) so they will be faster.</em>
</p>
<h3>
  Save your backup jobs
</h3>
<p>
  As a security measure, perform a settings backup to save your backup jobs if you have to reinstall your {PLATFORM}. Click Settings in the menu and then Backup settings
