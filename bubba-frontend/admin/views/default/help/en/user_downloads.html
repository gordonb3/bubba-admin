  Downloads
</h3>
<p>
  Use the {PLATFORM} download manager to download files directly to your {PLATFORM}, wherever you are. The only thing you need is a internet connection and a web browser.
</p>
<p>
  Surf to www.-your easyfind name-.{EASYFIND}. Of course if you already are in your home network browse to http://{DEFAULT_HOST}/admin.
</p>
<p>
  Large, time consuming downloads are handled by {PLATFORM} while your computer is turned off. When you initiate your first download a catalogue is created in your /home/[username]/ folder:
  /home/[username]/downloads.

  More information
</h3>
<p>
  As you add files for download, {PLATFORM} allocates disk space for the files. If you look in the /home/[username]/downloads/ catalogue it seems as if the files exist but as long as the progress bar still
  not has reached 100% the files are not complete.
</p>
<p>
  Currently the download manager support the standards HTTP, FTP and bittorrent downloads. You don't need to open any ports in your firewall when using the download manager, but for torrent downloads
  it is recommended to open the ports 10000-14000 in the Firewall settings.
</p>
<p>
  NOTE: When downloading bittorrents, note that the download manager will continue to share the file until you press 'Cancel' or 'Clear'.
