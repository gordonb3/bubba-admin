<h3>
  Extending your disk
</h3>
<p>
  Extend your home partition with an attached external disk. This will create a single logical volume of the internal home partition and an attached disk. In other words, you will experience one big
  disk instead of two smaller. The total disk size will be the external disk size added to home partition size.
</p>
<h3>
  Warning
</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Please notice that this is a non reversible operation. After your system has been extended together with the external drive, your system will always need to be connected to the external
  drive - and will not function without it. To be able to use your {PLATFORM} standalone again, you will need to reinstall the whole system.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>An old LVM disk will automatically be connected and included into the {PLATFORM} system upon boot, even though you have not set up your {PLATFORM} for an LVM extension. It is impossible to remove the
  extension without reinstallation. To format an old external LVM extended disk, connect the disk to a already running {PLATFORM}. Then choose 'Format' in the 'Disk -&gt; Information' menu.</strong>
</p>
