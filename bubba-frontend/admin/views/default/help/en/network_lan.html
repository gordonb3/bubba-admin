<h3>
  LAN
</h3>
<p>
  Here you configure how you reach your {PLATFORM} from computers in your Local Area Network (LAN). Your {PLATFORM} has an auto detect function on the LAN port. This means that when connected, {PLATFORM} will search
  the LAN for a DHCP server. If a DHCP server is found, {PLATFORM} will configure itself to obtain an IP address on the LAN port.
  </p>
<p>
  <strong>Obtain IP-address automatically</strong> - Use this option if you use another DHCP server than {PLATFORM} in your LAN, for example a router or gateway. {PLATFORM} will obtain an IP address
  automatically.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Use static IP address settings -</strong> Your {PLATFORM} will be reached on this static IP address in your LAN. The default fall back IP is : <a href='http://192.168.10.1' target=
  '_blank'>192.168.10.1</a>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Enable DNS service</strong> - The Domain Name System (DNS) translates domain names into IP addresses. When you type in a domain name, the DNS server translates the name into the
    corresponding IP address.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Enable DHCP server</strong> - The DHCP server gives out IP addresses when a device, connected into {PLATFORM}'s LAN port, is starting up and requests an IP address. The device must be set as a
    DHCP client to 'Obtain IP address automatically'.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Lease range</strong> - The DHCP address pool (Lease range) contains the range of the IP address that will automatically be assigned to the clients (for example computers, media players)
    on the network.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Enable Jumbo frames</strong> - This option enables transmissions of larger data chunks on the LAN interface. <strong>WARNING</strong> - this requires that all equipment on the LAN works in
  this environment. Use with caution. That said, this feature can improve performance on file transfers between {PLATFORM} and Gigabit capable devices.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>DHCP leases</strong> - Shows the current network devices in your LAN when having {PLATFORM} as your router. If several network devices has the same hostname the last connected will be shown as a
  *.
