<p>B3 can act as either a bridge, non-exit relay or exit relay in the Tor
network. The Tor network relies on volunteers to donate bandwidth. The
more people who run bridges or relays, the faster the Tor network will
be. If you have at least 20 kilobytes/s each way, please help out Tor
by configuring your B3 to be either a bridge non-exit relay or exit
relay.</p>

<h3>Relays</h3>

<p>The public servers in the Tor network are called relays. All of the
relays are listed in public directories, which means that anyone can
easily get a list of all the relays in the Tor network. A Tor relay
can be either a non-exit relay or an exit relay. A non-exit relay will
only forward traffic on to other relays in the Tor network. An exit
relay can either forward traffic on to other relays in the Tor
network, or to public Internet resources.</p>

<h3>Bridges</h3>

<p>Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) attempt to prevent users from
accessing the Tor network by blocking connections to known Tor relays.
Bridge relays (or <i>bridges</i> for short) are non-exit relays that
help these censored users access the Tor network. Unlike other Tor
relays, bridges are not listed in the same public directories as
normal relays. Since there is no complete public list of them, even if
your ISP is filtering connections to all the known Tor relays, they
probably won't be able to block all the bridges.</p>

<h3>The settings</h3>

<h4>Tor</h4>

<p>Switch to enable or disable the Tor service on the B3.</p>

<h4>Type of relay</h4>

<p>A dropdown that allows you to choose whether you want to set up and
run a Tor bridge, non-exit relay or exit relay.</p>

<h4>Bridge address</h4>

<p>You can let others access your Tor bridge by giving them this line.
The bridge address consists of your external IP address and the relay
port configured for Tor.</p>

<h4>Nickname</h4>

<p>The name which your relay will be known as in the Tor network. An
example of a relay nickname is \"MyB3Relay\".</p>

<h4>Contact information</h4>

<p>Contact info, such as an email address, to be published in relay
directories, so that the Tor Project can contact you if your relay is
misconfigured or something else goes wrong. You might also include
your PGP or GPG key ID and fingerprint. Note that Google indexes the
relay directories, so spammers might decide to collect this
information.</p>

<h4>Relay port</h4>

<p>The port on which your relay will listen for traffic from clients or
other Tor relays.</p>

<h4>Directory port</h4>

<p>The port on which your relay will listen for directory connections.
This enables your B3 to mirror Tor's directory of relays for others on
the network.</p>

<h4>Automatically distribute my bridge address</h4>

<p>If this option is selected, your bridge address will automatically be
distributed to users around the world.</p>

<h4>Bandwidth limits</h4>

<p>Running a Tor relay can consume a large amount of bandwidth; however,
Tor allows you to limit the amount of bandwidth that you are willing
to contribute to the Tor network. You can run a relay, while still
keeping your network connection usable for your own use. A bridge will
usually see less traffic than a bridge, and thus consume less
bandwidth, but you can set a bandwidth limit if you want. You should
select the option in the dropdown box that best matches your
connection speed. If you select Custom, you will be able to specify
your own limits.</p>

<h4>Custom bandwidth limits</h4>

<p>The maximum rate is a pool of bytes used to fulfill requests during
short periods of traffic higher than your specified average rate, but
still maintains the average over a long period. A low average rate but
a high maximum rate enforces a long-term average while still allowing
more traffic during peak times if the average hasn't been reached
lately. If your average rate is the same as your maximum rate, then
Tor will never exceed the specified rate. Your maximum rate must
always be greater than or equal to your average rate.</p>

<p>The average rate is the maximum long-term average bandwidth allowed
(in kilobytes per second). For example, you might want to choose 2
megabytes per second (2048 KB/s), or 50 kilobytes per second (a
medium-speed cable connection). Tor requires a minimum of 20 kilobytes
per second to run a relay.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that Tor measures bandwidth in bytes, not
bits. Also, Tor only looks at incoming bytes instead of outgoing
bytes. For example, if your relay acts as a directory mirror, you may
be sending more outgoing bytes than incoming. If you find this is the
case
and is putting too much strain on your bandwidth, you should consider
unchecking the checkbox labeled Mirror the relay directory.</p>

<h4>Exit policies</h4>

<p>Exit policies give you a way to specify what kinds of resources on the
Internet you are willing let other Tor users access from your Tor
relay. Tor uses a default list of exit policies that restrict some
services, such as mail to prevent spam and some default file sharing
ports to reduce abuse of the Tor network.</p>

<p>Each of the checkboxes represents a type of resource that you can
allow Tor users to access through your relay. If you uncheck the box
next to a particular type of resource, Tor users will not be allowed
to access that resource from your relay. If the box labeled Misc Other
Services is checked, Tor users will be able to access other services
not covered by the other checkboxes or Tor's default exit policy.</p>

<p>For completeness, the following table lists the specific port numbers
represented by each of the exit policy checkboxes. The Description
column describes the resources Tor clients will be allowed to access
through your relay, if the associated box is checked.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Websites</strong>, port 80, Normal, unencrypted Web browsing</li>
	<li><strong>Secure Websites</strong>, port 443, Encrypted Web browsing</li>
	<li><strong>Retrieve Mail</strong>, port 110, 143, 993, 995, Downloading email (does not permit sending email)</li>
	<li><strong>Instant Messaging</strong>, port 703, 1863, 5050, 5190, 5222, 5223, 8300, 8888, Instant messaging applications like MSN Messenger, AIM, ICQ, and Jabber</li>
	<li><strong>Internet Relay Chat (IRC)</strong>, port 6660-6669, 6697, 7000-7001, IRC clients and servers</li>
	<li><strong>Misc. Other Services</strong>, all ports, All other applications that aren't covered by the previous checkboxes</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not want to let other Tor users make connections outside the
Tor network from your relay, choose bridge or non-exit relay instead.</p>
