<p>The Tor network relies on volunteers to donate bandwidth. The
more people who run bridges or relays, the faster the Tor network will
be. If you have at least 20 kilobytes/s each way, please help out Tor
by configuring your B3 to be either a bridge non-exit relay or exit
relay.</p>

<p>B3 can act as either a bridge, non-exit relay or exit relay in the Tor
network: </p>

<h3>Relays</h3>

<p>The public servers in the Tor network are called relays. All of the
relays are listed in public directories, which means that anyone can
easily get a list of all the relays in the Tor network. A Tor relay
can be either a non-exit relay or an exit relay. A non-exit relay will
only forward traffic on to other relays in the Tor network. An exit
relay can either forward traffic on to other relays in the Tor
network, or to public Internet resources.</p>

<h3>Bridges</h3>

<p>Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) attempt to prevent users from
accessing the Tor network by blocking connections to known Tor relays.
Bridge relays (or <i>bridges</i> for short) are non-exit relays that
help these censored users access the Tor network. Unlike other Tor
relays, bridges are not listed in the same public directories as
normal relays. Since there is no complete public list of them, even if
your ISP is filtering connections to all the known Tor relays, they
probably won't be able to block all the bridges.</p>

<h3>The settings</h3>

<p>The default settings are the recommended settings, so if you are unsure, just leave them as is. </p>

<h4>Bridge address</h4>

<p>You can let others access your Tor bridge by giving them this line.
The bridge address consists of your external IP address and the relay
port configured for Tor.</p>

<h4>Nickname</h4>

<p>The name which your relay will be known as in the Tor network. 
Example: \"MyB3Relay\".</p>

<h4>Contact information</h4>

<p>Contact info, such as an email address, to be published in relay
directories, so that the Tor Project can contact you if your relay is
misconfigured or something else goes wrong.</p>

<h4>Automatically distribute my bridge address</h4>

<p>If not selected only people invited by you can use your bridge.</p>

<h4>Exit policies</h4>

<p>Exit policies give you a way to specify what kinds of resources on the
Internet you are willing let other Tor users access from your Tor
relay. Tor uses a default list of exit policies that restrict some
services, such as mail to prevent spam and some default file sharing
ports to reduce abuse of the Tor network.</p>

<p>Please read the users manual for more detailed information on this.</p>
