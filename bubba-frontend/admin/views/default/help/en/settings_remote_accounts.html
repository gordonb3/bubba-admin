<h3>Remote accounts</h3>
<p>
This page holds settings for remote accounts used mainly for the backup feature. Accounts that are added here will be available as targets in the backup feature, and also be available under /home/admin in the file manager, for direct access.
</p>

<p>
The public key - where available - has to be stored on the target in order for the B3 to log on automatically. For ssh this is done automatically, but for HiDrive this has to be done manually, in HiDrive web portals settings.
