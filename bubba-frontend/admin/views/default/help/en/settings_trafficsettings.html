<h3>
  Traffic
</h3>
<p>
  To control the maximum upload / download speed on your torrents adjust the 'Traffic' setting.
</p>
<p>
  For example if you have a limited broadband connection you do not want to fill your uplink completely. Then set the 'Max upload speed' to a preferred value. Use 'Max download speed' in the same
  manner.
</p>
<p>
  Using -1 as value = no speed limit.
