"B3 can act as either a bridge, non-exit relay or exit relay in the Tor "
"network. The Tor network relies on volunteers to donate bandwidth. The more "
"people who run bridges or relays, the faster the Tor network will be. If you "
"have at least 20 kilobytes/s each way, please help out Tor by configuring "
"your B3 to be either a bridge non-exit relay or exit relay."
