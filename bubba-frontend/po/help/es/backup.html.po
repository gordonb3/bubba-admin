"This backup service allows you to backup any data on your {PLATFORM} to a "
"USB disk, an eSATA disk or to a remote server supporting FTP or SSH "
"protocols. For instance you can create a backup from one {PLATFORM} to "
"another using the SSH protocol, and using the EasyFind name as the “target "
"server”."

"The backup service is timelined, hence you can choose to restore your data "
"from any of the backup occasions. For instance if you create a backup job "
"you run hourly, and need to restore a file to the state it had four hours "
"earlier, this is possible."

"The backup can also be run differentially. This means that it will only send "
"changes that might have taken place in your data. If no changes are made, no "
"data is being sent and no additional storage space is used on the target."

"You can also choose to encrypt the backup. If you choose this, the backup is "
"encrypted both during transfer to target and on the actual target. This "
"allows you to send backups to untrusted servers without worrying that "
"someone might read your backup data."
