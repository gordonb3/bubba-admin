msgid "The public servers in the Tor network are called relays. All of the relays are listed in public directories, which means that anyone can easily get a list of all the relays in the Tor network. A Tor relay can be either a non-exit relay or an exit relay. A non-exit relay will only forward traffic on to other relays in the Tor network. An exit relay can either forward traffic on to other relays in the Tor network, or to public Internet resources."

msgid "Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) attempt to prevent users from accessing the Tor network by blocking connections to known Tor relays.  Bridge relays (or <i>bridges</i> for short) are non-exit relays that help these censored users access the Tor network. Unlike other Tor relays, bridges are not listed in the same public directories as normal relays. Since there is no complete public list of them, even if your ISP is filtering connections to all the known Tor relays, they probably won't be able to block all the bridges."
